# Machine-Learning
## A repo based around machine learning algorithms from a tuition course.  
  
Exercise 1 - Linear Regression with gradient descent, feature scaling/mean normalization and using the normal equation.  
Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression with gradient descent as well as regularized logistic regression.  
Exercise 3 - Part 1 : MultiClass Classification on handwritten digits using regularized one-vs-all logistic regression. Part 2 : The same classification of handwritten numbers, but using a neural network with predetermined values for theta.
